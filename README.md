## Hello 👋

Hey there! I’m Sneha Gupta, a **Data Analyst** and **Computational Physicist**, based in Toronto 🇨🇦. I have over 8 years of research experience at [Institute for Plasma Research, Govt. of India](https://www.ipr.res.in/), where I specialized in scientific computing, numerical simulations, data analytics, and visualization. I’m also a **Machine Learning enthusiast**, bridging my computational physics foundation with modern data science techniques through ongoing learning at the [University of Toronto](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/).

I hold dual master’s degrees in advanced Physics, including one from the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi)](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). I’m passionate about transforming complex, large-scale data into meaningful insights and using computational tools to solve challenging real-world problems.

🏆 My most significant achievement is a [research publication](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5090559) on space propulsion technology in the peer-reviewed journal [Physics Of Plasmas](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop). Throughout my career, I’ve received multiple awards for excellence in research and academics, and I’ve consistently ranked among the top candidates in national-level competitive exams such as [GATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering), [IIT-JAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Admission_Test_for_Masters), [NET-JRF](https://ugcnet.nta.ac.in/), known for their rigorous selection and high competition.

When I’m not crunching data, you’ll find me enjoying time with family, discovering new shows and movies, or unwinding outdoors in nature. 🌿
